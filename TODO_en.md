# SQL Desk — TODO (EN)

*List of planned features, bug fixes, and improvement ideas for **SQL Desk**.*

> This file is a structured, English re‑organisation of the original French TODO. Nothing has been removed unless it was strictly redundant. Historical notes are preserved in Part II.

---

## PART I — BACKLOG (TO‑DO)

### A. Critical items

* [ ] **Refactor – Database menu refresh:** decouple UI from DB logic

  * Move UI wiring (lambdas) to `sql_desk.py` and keep `database_management.py` pure (no Tkinter).
  * Add a pure helper (e.g. `get_recent_db_entries()`) returning recent DB items.
  * Define static menu items once; refresh only the dynamic “Recent DBs” section.
* [ ] **Create a database in a user‑chosen directory** (also listed under Major tracks — kept intentionally; see Part I‑B).
* [ ] **Show PK and FK in “List Tables”.**
* [ ] **Comment colouring for** `--` **and** `/* ... */`.
* [ ] **Add a SQL help file in English** (`HELP_SQL_BASICS.md`) plus a short user guide for SQL Desk.
* [ ] **Export query results to CSV or TXT.**
* [ ] **Optional export of results and SQL code to Markdown (`.md`).**
* [ ] **Local history of executed queries** (e.g., for quick recall; note: *keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y / Ctrl+S are already handled in the editor*).
* [ ] **Preserve caret position and vertical scroll** in `sql_textbox` after `pretty_print_sql()` (**currently jumps to the top**).
* [ ] **Fix the “Quit” button.**
* [ ] **Refactor – `refresh_db_file_menu()`**: move lambda/UI concerns into `sql_desk.py`.
* [ ] **Suggested enhancement – Execution summary:** brief recap after running SQL (counts of statements, successes, errors).

#### Documentation / User Guide – Foreign keys

**PRAGMA foreign\_keys = ON;**
SQLite does not enforce referential integrity by default. In SQL Desk, the following command is executed automatically on every connection to ensure foreign keys (including composite keys) are enforced:

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```

Without this, one could insert in `Booking` an activity that does not exist in `Activity`, or one that mismatches the `resortName`, breaking query correctness and database consistency.
**Action:** document this behaviour clearly so users understand why the app always enables this option.

---

### B. Major tracks (post‑GitHub migration)

> To be integrated as soon as possible to support smooth execution of complete SQL scripts.

* [ ] Create a database in the desired directory (**duplicate of A; intentionally retained**).
* [ ] Display PK/FK in List Tables (**duplicate of A; intentionally retained**).
* [ ] Comment colouring for `--` and `/* ... */` (**duplicate of A; intentionally retained**).

---

### C. Pedagogical ideas

* [ ] Add example databases (e.g., `School.db`, `Library.db`, `Cinema.db`).
* [ ] Add a **student mode** (read‑only; no DROP/ALTER).
* [ ] Add a SQL help file in English (`HELP_SQL_BASICS.md`).
* [ ] Add a `README_fr.md` as a French user guide.

---

### D. Future development

* [ ] Export query results to CSV or TXT.
* [ ] Optional export of results and SQL code to Markdown (`.md`).
* [ ] Local history of executed queries.
* [ ] Multi‑language UI (English / French at minimum).
* [ ] Possible integration in a Jupyter‑like environment.
* [ ] Simple extension / plugin system (formatting helpers, snippets, etc.).

---

### E. Technical priorities

* [ ] **Simple Save (Ctrl+S) —** `GUI_functions.py`

  * Add `current_sql_file` to `global_vars.py` (path of the current file).
  * Implement `save_sql_code(sql_textbox, menu, force_save_as=False)`:

    * If `current_sql_file` exists and `force_save_as` is `False` ⇒ overwrite that file.
    * Otherwise ⇒ open a “Save As” dialog and update `current_sql_file`.
    * No Unicode in the code; end with `return None`.
  * **“SQL File” menu:**

    * Add **Save** (above **Save As**).
    * **Save** calls `save_sql_code(..., force_save_as=False)`.
    * **Save As** calls `save_sql_code(..., force_save_as=True)`.
  * **Shortcuts:**

    * **Ctrl+S** ⇒ Save (unless the file has not yet been named ⇒ Save As).
    * **Ctrl+Shift+S** ⇒ Save As.
  * **On “Open…”:** in `open_sql_code(...)`, set `global_vars.current_sql_file = filepath`.
  * **Acceptance criteria:**

    * Ctrl+S overwrites the same file if already named; otherwise opens Save As.
    * Menu shows **Save** and **Save As** correctly.
    * After **Open…**, Ctrl+S targets the opened file.
    * Errors handled with `messagebox.showerror`.

---

### F. Known issues & formatting notes

* **Line‑break at start** in `insert_linebreaks_before_keywords`:

  * **Situation:** if the text starts with a keyword (e.g., `SELECT`), the function inserts a `\n` at the very beginning, then `.strip()` removes it.
  * **Potential issue:** may cause problems if code is reused without `.strip()`.
  * **Planned fix:** avoid inserting `\n` when the keyword is at position 0 (negative look‑behind `(?<!^)` or index test).
  * **Status:** To do.

* **Remove spaces before line breaks** in `insert_linebreaks_before_keywords`:

  * After insertion, a space may remain before `\n` (e.g., `* \nFROM`).
  * **Solution:**

    ```python
    re.sub(r"[ \t]+\n", "\n", formatted)
    ```

* **SQL comment formatting & colouring**

  * **Situation:** `-- ...` (and later `/* ... */`) are not coloured and are affected by pretty print (e.g., keywords upper‑cased inside comments).
  * **Problem:** formatter modifies comment content (legibility, meaning).
  * **Objectives:**

    * Colour comments in the editor (e.g., grey/italic).
    * Exclude comments from `highlight_keywords` and other transforms.
  * **Approach:**

    * Step 1: line comments `--`; Step 2: block comments `/* ... */`.
    * Adapt `highlight_keywords(text)` to ignore segments marked as comments:

      * Line‑by‑line parse: split `code_part` / `comment_part` using `--`.
      * Uppercase only `code_part`, then concat `code_part + comment_part` unchanged.
    * (Optional) Add Tk tag `sql_comment` with `foreground="#888"` and `slant="italic"`.
  * **Status:** To do.

## PART II — HISTORY & IN‑DEPTH NOTES

> This section preserves the chronological record and design notes from the original file.

### A. “Done” (historical checklist)

* [x] Insert a blank line after every output in the console, not just in `make_pretty_table` — **23 Jul 2025**

* [x] Allow execution of the **selected range** in the SQL editor, if any — **23 Jul 2025**

* [x] Allow execution of SQL scripts containing multiple `;`.

  #### \[Originally To‑Do] Multi‑statement script execution (`;`)

  **Goal:** execute a block with multiple statements (`DROP TABLE`, `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, etc.) separated by semicolons **in a single run**.

  **Pitfalls:**

  1. **Do not just `split(';')`:** a semicolon may appear **inside a string** (e.g., `'I like ; separators'`) and must not split.
  2. **Detect semicolons outside strings:** traverse SQL char‑by‑char while tracking state:

     * `in_single_quote = True/False`
     * `in_double_quote = True/False`
     * Only split on `;` **outside quotes**

  —> **Marked as done on 09 Aug 2025**

* [x] Refine automatic line breaks in SQL formatting:

  * Do **not** insert `\n` between `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `INNER`, etc. and `JOIN`.
  * Add a line break before `JOIN` **only** when `JOIN` appears by itself.
    *(Implemented in `utils.py` on 22 Jul 2025.)*

* [x] Check scrollable areas (results, SQL editor, …) — **23 Jul 2025**

* [x] Ensure the "Recent files" menus (DB and SQL) update immediately — **23 Jul 2025**

  * Fixed immediate refresh of the menu after opening or saving files.
  * Passed `menu` parameter to `open_sql_code` and `save_sql_code`.
  * Menu refresh handled inside open/save functions.

* [ ] Check readability of long queries in the output area.

* [ ] Provide a clearer error when **no database** is selected.

---

### B. Changelog (by date)

#### 23 Jul 2025

* [x] Execute the **selected** SQL in the editor (when present).
  Updated `run_query` to detect a selection in the SQL widget. If there is a selection, only that part is executed; otherwise the whole editor content is executed.
  Preserved selection before/after pretty print to keep highlighting.
  Fixed issues executing multiple statements by consolidating older `run_sql` and `run_sql_pretty` into `run_query`.
  Updated UI so the **Run SQL** button triggers the unified function.

* Fixed immediate refresh of the "Recent files" menus (SQL and DB).
  Removed obsolete functions `run_sql` and `run_sql_pretty` (not used for a long time).
  Consider renaming `run_query` to `run_sql` later, especially if multi‑statement execution is expanded.

#### 22 Jul 2025

* Improved automatic line breaks re: `JOIN` handling.
* Reviewed scroll ergonomics (editor and output).

#### 25 Jul 2025 — Migration to `/src/` and recent DB menu refresh bugfix

* Moved main `.py` files to `src/`: `sql_desk.py`, `GUI_functions.py`, `database_management.py`, `utils.py`, `global_vars.py`.
* Recent DB menu now updates **without restart**: moved `refresh_db_file_menu()` from `utils.py` to `database_management.py` to avoid import cycles. It is now called at the end of `choose_database()` so open/create always refreshes the menu.
* Behaviour aligns with recent SQL files menu (which already refreshed immediately).
* Temporary debug `print()` calls left in place; **NEXT SESSION PRIORITY:** remove debug prints and the unused function in `sql_desk.py`.

#### Preserve caret and scroll in `pretty_print_sql` — ✅

**Context.** Reformatting would reset caret and viewport to top.

**Changes.**

* Save state before formatting:

  * caret: `insert_idx = sql_textbox.index("insert")`
  * selection: attempt `sel.first` / `sel.last`
  * vertical scroll: `top_frac = sql_textbox.yview()[0]`
  * horizontal scroll (if enabled): `x_frac = sql_textbox.xview()[0]`
* Make the format pass (line breaks, blank line after `;`, optional `--` comments, upper‑case keywords), wrapped as **one undo step** via `edit_separator()`.
* Replace buffer, recolour, and **restore** caret/selection/scroll. Ensure visibility with `see("insert")` and `focus_set()`.

**Notes.** Idempotent behaviour expected; tiny caret drifts may occur if text is inserted/removed before caret. Optional “cursor sentinel” can pin the logical position if ever required.

#### 09 Aug 2025 — Session progress

* **utils.py** – Improved `insert_linebreaks_before_keywords()` to avoid inserting an initial line break; tests validated.
* **TODO.md** – Updated entries for line‑break handling.
* **.gitignore** – Added `test*.py`.
* **GUI\_functions.py, database\_management.py, sql\_desk.py** – Minor adjustments.
* **EcoAdv.db** – Updated example DB.
* **Git** – Commit and push with a clear message.

**Planned rename of `run_query()` to `run_sql()`**
The new `run_sql()` would handle both a single query (or selected range) **and** a multi‑statement script separated by `;`.

#### 10 Aug 2025 — Show number of affected rows

* **Context:** display a message after `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` indicating how many rows were modified.
* **Target:** immediate feedback on the impact of write queries.
* **Files:** `sql_functions.py` (`run_sql()` or `run_query()` as currently implemented).
* **Detail:** use `cursor.rowcount` and append the info at the end of execution.

#### 10 Aug 2025 — Fix **Quit** button

* **Issue:** the **Quit** button was stopping the mainloop in the console, but the Tk window stayed open and usable.
* **Cause:** button used `window.quit` instead of `on_closing()` which saves recent files then closes properly.
* **Fix:** replace `command=window.quit` with `command=lambda: on_closing(window)` in `sql_desk.py`.
* **Result:** ensures recent file lists are saved and the window closes cleanly.
* **Files:** `sql_desk.py`, `utils.py` (`on_closing()` already present).

#### 10 Aug 2025 — Refactor database menu refresh

* **Goal:** separate UI from business logic and avoid rebuilding static items on every refresh.
* **Changes:**

  1. Moved `refresh_db_file_menu()` from `database_management.py` to `GUI_functions.py`.
  2. Keep initial creation of Database menu/button in `sql_desk.py` (static items `Open Database…`, `Create New Database…`).
  3. Update `refresh_db_file_menu()` to refresh **only** dynamic entries (recent DBs), e.g., `menu.delete(3, 'end')` after a separator.
  4. Updated `menu_open_database()` and `create_new_database()` to call the new UI‑level `refresh_db_file_menu()`.
* **Note:** chose import option 2 (let `database_management.py` import the UI refresher). This creates a mild cross‑import but is acceptable; monitor in later refactors.
* **Result:** same behaviour, with centralised UI and dynamic refresh only.

#### 12 Aug 2025 — Refactor Quit & connection handling; DB creation flow — ✅

* **Quit button:** now properly closes any open SQLite connections before exiting.
* **`run_sql()`:** stop creating a new connection every time; reuse `global_vars.current_connection` so there is a single persistent connection per session.
* **`create_new_database()`:**

  * Remove direct call to `refresh_db_file_menu()` (menu now refreshed by the GUI after creation).
  * Immediately open the new DB via `choose_database()` to apply unified connection and initialisation logic.
* **Compatibility** verified between `database_management.py` and `GUI_functions.py` post‑refactor.
* **Bug fix** in `make_pretty_table()` (argument order `headers, rows`) eliminating `object of type 'int' has no len()` errors on some `SELECT`s.
* **Comment clean‑up:** avoid any UTF‑8 non‑ASCII characters in code comments.

#### 13 Aug 2025 — Pretty Print affects SQL comments

* **Description:** `pretty_print_sql()` also transforms inside comments (e.g., adding a line break after a keyword found in a comment).
* **Impact:** comments can be distorted (e.g., `-- Schema based\nON the exercise ...`).
* **Proposed fix:** ignore any line starting with `--` (after trimming leading spaces). Consider `/* ... */` as well.
* **Priority:** Medium (visual impact; no SQL error).
* **Status:** To do.

#### 13 Aug 2025 — Truncated headers (first letter only)

* **Issue:** column names were reduced to their first letter (`a, n, g, c`…), making tables unreadable.
* **Cause:** `make_pretty_table()` used `[col[0] for col in info]` even when `info` was already `list[str]`, thus truncating each name to one character.
* **Fix:** add `isinstance(info[0], str)` guard and handle that case directly.
* **Status:** Fixed.

#### 17 Aug 2025 — PK/FK styling in table list — ✅

* Improved `get_tables()`: primary keys in red, foreign keys marked with `#`.
* Added `tag_config` in `sql_desk.py` to style text (PK red, FK hash, etc.).
* Updated `display_result()` in `utils.py` to accept both plain and tagged text; kept backward compatibility.
* Preserved append‑only behaviour for console output.
* Tested successfully with **SkillUp** DB: PKs shown in red, FKs marked with `#`.

#### 26 Aug 2025 — Editor shortcuts and undo — ✅

* **Keyboard shortcuts in the SQL editor**

  * Ctrl+Z → Undo
  * Ctrl+Y / Ctrl+Shift+Z → Redo
  * Ctrl+S → Save As (temporary)
* **Undo history enabled**

  * `undo=True`, `maxundo=2000`, `autoseparators=True`

**How it was done (brief):**
Enabled Tkinter’s native undo on `ScrolledText`; bound `Ctrl+Z` → `<<Undo>>`, `Ctrl+Y` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z` → `<<Redo>>`, `Ctrl+S` → `save_sql_file()`; `save_sql_file()` opens `asksaveasfilename`, writes UTF‑8, and handles errors with `messagebox`.

**Notes:**
Simple **Save** (overwrite) is not implemented yet; for now, **Ctrl+S** always triggers Save As.

---

## PART III — OPTIONAL APPENDICES

### A. Creation of new databases — UI improvement (kept from the original text)

**Current situation**

* Uses `simpledialog.askstring` to request only a filename.
* DB is created in the working directory.
* No folder choice; risk of invalid names; potential overwrite without warning.

**Problem**

* User cannot choose the file location.
* Filenames may contain problematic characters (spaces, accents, etc.).
* No check before overwriting existing files.

**Desired improvement**

* Use `filedialog.asksaveasfilename` to let the user choose **both** name and location.
* Add `.db` by default via `defaultextension`.
* Let Tkinter prompt before overwriting.

**How to proceed**

1. Replace `askstring` with `asksaveasfilename`.
2. Check for a non‑empty `filepath` (user may cancel).
3. Create the file at the chosen location.
4. Update `global_vars.current_database` with the full path.
5. Add this path to `recent_db_files` like in `menu_open_database`.

**Minimal example**

```python
def create_new_database(output_textbox, window=None, db_menu=None):
    filepath = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(
        title="Create New Database",
        defaultextension=".db",
        filetypes=[("SQLite Database", "*.db"), ("All Files", "*.*")]
    )
    if filepath:
        with open(filepath, "w"):
            pass
        global_vars.current_database = filepath
        display_result(output_textbox, f"Created new database: {os.path.basename(filepath)}")
        global_vars.recent_db_files.insert(0, filepath)
        global_vars.recent_db_files = list(dict.fromkeys(global_vars.recent_db_files))[:10]
        save_recent_files("recent_db_files.txt", global_vars.recent_db_files)
        if db_menu is not None:
            refresh_db_file_menu(db_menu, output_textbox, window)
```

### B. Quit button — clean exit (kept from the original text)

**Goal:** make **Quit** call `window.destroy()` (or `root.destroy()`), optionally with a confirmation dialog.
**Minimal example**

```python
from tkinter import messagebox

def quit_app(window):
    if messagebox.askokcancel("Quit", "Do you really want to exit?"):
        window.destroy()


```

#### 01 Nov 2025 — Repository clean-up, `.gitignore` update, and database creation workflow

* **.gitignore**
  * Simplified and modernised for a cleaner repository layout.
  * Keeps all code under `/src`, documentation files (`.docx`, `.pdf`, `.md`), and teaching materials (`sample_databases/`).
  * Ignores cache files, local databases, virtual environments, and temporary folders such as `Old/` or backup directories like `src-2025-...`.

* **Database creation**
  * `create_new_database()` successfully refactored with `filedialog.asksaveasfilename` to let users pick both the directory and filename.
  * Integrated immediate database opening via `choose_database()` for smoother workflow.
  * Tested with new sample databases — fully functional.

* **Repository organisation**
  * Confirmed that `/WorkingArea` is the root of the Git repository.
  * `/src` now clearly hosts all core Python modules.
  * `sample_databases/` kept under version control (pedagogical examples).

* **Next development focus**
  * Comment colouring and protection (`--` and `/* ... */`).
  * Goal: preserve comments during Pretty Print and display them in grey italics.

### 2025-11-01 — Codebase documentation and cleanup
- Rewrote all docstrings and inline comments in Queen’s English.
- Removed obsolete commented-out code fragments and minor redundancies.
- Ensured consistent style, indentation, and tone across all core modules (`sql_desk.py`, `GUI_functions.py`, `database_management.py`, `utils.py`).
- Verified that logic and functionality remain unchanged.



#### 03 Nov 2025 - Pretty Print bug — line breaks inserted after comment markers

**Date:** 2025-11-03  
**Category:** Pretty Print / Safety

**Description:**  
The Pretty Print function introduces unwanted line breaks right after the `--` comment marker.  
As a result, commented SQL queries are split over two lines:
the `--` remains alone, while the SQL code moves to the next line and becomes executable.

**Observed behaviour:**  
```sql
-- SELECT * FROM Role;
```
is reformatted as:
```sql
--
SELECT * FROM Role;
```
Hence, on the next execution, the SQL statements run even though they were originally commented out.

**Expected behaviour:**  
- Preserve comments and their associated lines as single logical units.  
- Never insert a newline between `--` and the text following it.

**Suggested fixes:**  
1. Detect lines starting with `--` and treat them as atomic (no internal line breaks).  
2. Render them in Dark metallic Green for readability but never reflow them.  
3. Add regression tests using seed scripts (like GalaxyQuest) to ensure comment integrity.

**Priority:**  **High (execution safety)**


#### 03 Nov 2025 - Excessive blank lines in output:
The console currently inserts multiple empty lines between successive messages or result tables, making the output unnecessarily long and harder to read.
Normalise the spacing so that only one blank line is displayed between result blocks, and remove redundant leading or trailing empty lines.
The objective is to produce a compact, consistent layout that remains visually clear after multiple executions.


#### 04 Nov 2025 - 

1. Add spacing around operators in Pretty Print
Insert one idempotent space on each side of = (and possibly other operators such as <, >, <=, >=, <>, +, -, *, /).

Example:
Current: IdRole=8
Desired: IdRole = 8

⚙️ Ensure that repeated formatting does not insert additional spaces (idempotence required).

2. Display NULL explicitly

When a database field has a NULL value, display NULL instead of leaving the cell blank.
Apply to all output formats (plain text and pretty table).
Keep alignment and column widths consistent.





#### (2025-12-13) Multi-row `INSERT` formatting (Pretty Print)

**Description**  
Currently, multi-row `INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...), (...), ...;` statements remain in a single block.  
The pretty printer does not detect commas separating tuples.

**Goal**  
Improve readability by inserting a newline between tuples while keeping commas inside tuples untouched.

**Possible approaches**  
1. **Regex approach (simple):**  
   ```python
   text = re.sub(r'\)\s*,\s*\(', '),\n(', text)



#### (2025-12-13) Output message colours (user feedback)

**Description**  
Currently, all output messages appear in black text, whether they are information, success, or error messages.  
To improve visual feedback and readability, it would be useful to apply distinct colours depending on message type.

**Proposal**
- 🔴 **Dark red** for error messages (SQLite exceptions, syntax errors, etc.)  
- 🟢 **Green** for success messages (`Query executed`, `Database opened`, etc.)  
- ⚫ **Black or neutral grey** for general information

**Technical notes**  
→ Use `tag_config()` in the `tk.Text` or `ScrolledText` widget to define colours at startup.  
→ Prefer dark red over bright red for readability on light backgrounds.  
→ Ensure compatibility with possible dark/light themes in future.

**Status:** to implement.



#### (2025-12-13) Font size not applied to "Tables in current database" section

**Description**  
When changing the output window font size, all text adjusts correctly except  
for the header line `"Tables in current database:"` and the table names listed below.

**Likely cause**  
These lines are inserted with dedicated tags (`tag_add`, `tag_config`) that define a fixed font  
(e.g. `("Consolas", 10, "bold")`) instead of inheriting from the global font configuration.

**Goal**  
Ensure that the header and table names follow the same font settings as the rest of the output window  
and resize properly when the user changes the font size.

**Technical suggestion**
- Define a shared `tk.font.Font` object for the output widget.  
- Use it for both `db_header` and `db_table` tags instead of hardcoded fonts.  
- Reconfigure this shared font when font size changes are triggered.

**Status:** to fix.


#### 06 Jan 2026 - P0 : Comment highlighting + safer Pretty Print whitespace

1. Add comment highlighting (line and block)

Implement syntax highlighting for SQL comments in the editor:

* Line comments : `-- ...`
* Block comments : `/* ... */` (including multi-line blocks)

Apply a dedicated colour tag (currently using a dark metallic green) and ensure that SQL keyword highlighting does not apply inside comment ranges.

2. Improve Pretty Print newline normalisation (preserve readability)

Fix Pretty Print whitespace rules so that:

* Empty lines between comment blocks are preserved (do not immediately collapse them).
* When users insert more than 3 consecutive blank lines, keep at most 2 empty lines (normalisation).
* Line breaks inserted before SQL keywords are idempotent and do not create unwanted extra blank lines (e.g. no blank line between `INSERT INTO ...` and `VALUES` when `VALUES` is already on a new line).

The objective is to keep the formatting stable and user-friendly, while remaining strictly idempotent after repeated executions.
